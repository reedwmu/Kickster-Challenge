Kickstarting with Excel - Anthony Reed

Overview of Project: Using pivot tables and charts to learn about out campaigns.

Purpose: To learn how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

Analysis and Challenges:
This analysis was used to help Louise learn how her play, Fever, compare to different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I first used pivot tables and graphing to help create an imagine of what the different outcomes were based on the launch date. In the second activity, I found the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. For each activity I created a chart that went along with the data set. I found during my challenge assignment that formatting is very important otherwise it can mess up the data set we are trying to obtain. I was able to correct my mistakes via trial and error with the formatting and reviewing prior lectures. 

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
The analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date looks to see how many theater outcomes were successful, cancelled or failed based on goal amount per month. The findings were that more outcomes were reported in the month of May and during this month we also so the highest number of successful outcomes compared to other months.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:
The analysis of Outcomes based on Goals looks to see the number of plays that were successful, failed or cancelled along with their corresponding percentages. These percentages were displayed using a line chart and found that the while the percentage of successful plays was majority greater, we are also see that the percentage of cancelled plays is fairly matched with the successful plays. The findings were that 52% of plays with funding goals of less than $1000 we successful in achieving said goal.

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:
Difficulties in this challenge include the formatting, using correct functions and filters the charts. With some trial and error, I was able to correct my formatting and function errors however I found that I had more trouble filtering my data sets/charts as the option was not available to my excel software. I reviewed this with the class/instructor and the solution was not found.





Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
By looking at our findings we can analyze that May is the ideal month to launch a play. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Most plays found a success rate of 52% in meeting their goal if their goal was less than $1,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We cannot guarantee that having a goal less than $1,000 will be successful but we will have a chance of a greater outcome if the play is in May.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could use a Histogram statistics chart to condense the data set into a visual aid by taking the data points and grouping them into logical ranges.
